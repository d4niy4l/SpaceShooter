# SpaceShooter
Semester project Spring 23 FAST NUCES ISLAMABAD
Arcade style space shooting game using c++ and sfml
Uses oop concepts (nothing too fancy)
Some of the things i did might seem dumb and unoptimized but the project requirement made it such that no built in functions and vectors were allowed
can make it more optimized by not deleting the enemies the moment they get destroyed but delete a bunch of them after a certain threshold (say 12) have been destroyed)
